Automatic License Plate Recognition (ANPR) ðŸš˜
===
The project deals with ANPR, which is the detection and recognition of license plates from vehicle images with the help of advanced image processing techniques. The focus will be on the optimization of the pre-processing steps and OCR accuracy by fine-tuning edge detection and filtering techniques to correctly extract alphanumerical data from license plates.

## Features
- Applied image preprocessing techniques, including bilateral filtering and Gaussian blur, for noise reduction.

- Implemented edge detection methods like Canny edge detection to enhance plate contours.

- Utilized morphological operations for improved plate isolation and text recognition.

- Evaluated OCR performance under different conditions to achieve accurate text extraction.

- Conducted parameter tuning to optimize filter values and edge detection thresholds.

## Preprocessing Techniques Used

- Bilateral Filtering: Applied with different parameter values to balance edge enhancement and noise reduction.

- Gaussian Blur: Used to reduce noise while preserving edges.

- Canny Edge Detection: Applied with varying thresholds to identify strong edges.

- Morphological Operations: Dilation and erosion used to enhance contours and reduce false positives.
